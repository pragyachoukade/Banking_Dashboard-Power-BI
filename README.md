## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis and reporting pipeline for a **Banking Dataset**, showcasing skills across data engineering, data analysis, and business intelligence visualization.

The process includes:
- Ingesting raw CSV data into SQL Server
- Performing data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python in Jupyter Notebook
- Connecting SQL Server to Power BI for visual reporting
- Designing an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to derive insights

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL Server** – Data storage and querying
- **Python** – Data transformation and EDA using Jupyter Notebook
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – For data analysis and visualization in Python
- **Power BI** – BI tool for building the dashboard and reports
- **Power Query & DAX** – Data cleaning, calculated columns, and measures in Power BI

## 📊 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Import & Storage
- Imported the raw CSV file into **SQL Server** for structured data management.

### 2. Data Transformation & EDA
- Connected SQL Server to **Jupyter Notebook using Python**.
- Performed data cleaning (handling nulls, type casting, removing duplicates).
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using:
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Correlation matrix
  - Visualizations using matplotlib & seaborn

### 3. Power BI Dashboard Creation
- Connected SQL Server as the data source in Power BI.
- Performed additional data cleaning using **Power Query**.
- Created **calculated columns** and **measures** using DAX for key metrics.
- Designed multiple report pages to cover various banking KPIs.
